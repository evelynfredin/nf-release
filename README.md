# NF | Clouds (The Mixtape) Release Event

This is a school project we have done together with students from the IP program. The main idea was to design and develop an invitation to a fictitious event from a real entity and follow their graphical identity.

We based our project on the release of NF's upcoming album Clouds (The Mixtape). The digital invitation or website had to be personified with two different parameters so we decided to go with Name and Location. Based on the latter, you are invited to attend the event phisically and RSVP on the spot or virtually, through a livestream for which you can purchase tickets to.
